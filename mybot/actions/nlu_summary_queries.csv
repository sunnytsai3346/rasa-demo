2025-05-04T21:04:53,What's the process for screen setup?,,Warp files provide image configuration information to support projection in environments with multipleprojectors and complex screen shapes. Warp files are created using an automated process through Christie Mystique. Copying existing screen file settings to a new screen file is a quick and easy way to duplicate settings. Deleting a screen file when it is no longer required is a more complex process.
